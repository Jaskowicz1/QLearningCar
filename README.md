# QLearning Car

This is my QLearning Car project. It's my first pure c++ project. I've been wanting to dwell into making a c++ only project for 2 years now and here we are!

Might need to change the name as I'm heading towards Neural Networking, rather than QLearning.

Libraries Used:
- SFML

Commands:
- ShowStats
- ShowFPS
- ShowCheckpoints

Credits:
- Nick Koirala, ahnonay, switchboy | collision (.cpp and .h)
